User Updates Profile → Form Submission.

File: Profile.js
User fills the form with updated data (e.g., username, email, password, avatar) and submits.

2. Redux Dispatches Action → Start Update Process.
File: Profile.js, userSlice.js
Dispatch updateUserStart action to indicate the update process has started (sets loading to true).

3. Frontend Sends POST Request → With Updated Data.
File: Profile.js
Send POST request to /api/user/update/:id with updated user data (form data).

4. Server Verifies Token → Authentication.
File: verifyUser.js
Use verifyToken middleware to check if the user is authenticated via JWT stored in cookies.

5. Controller Updates User → Checks Permissions, Hashes Password, Updates Database.
File: user.controller.js
In updateUser, ensure the logged-in user is the one making the update. Hash the new password if it’s provided and update the user’s info in MongoDB.

6. Response Sent to Frontend → User Updated or Error Occurred.
File: user.controller.js
Send updated user info (excluding password) back to the frontend, or return an error if something went wrong.

File: userSlice.js
Dispatch updateUserSuccess action to store updated user info in Redux state, or updateUserFailure if the update failed.

8. Profile Page Re-Renders → Shows Updated User Info.
File: Profile.js
The profile page re-renders automatically because the updated user info is stored in Redux, and useSelector grabs the new data.

File: MongoDB (Database)
MongoDB stores the new user data (username, email, password, avatar), and the database reflects the changes.
